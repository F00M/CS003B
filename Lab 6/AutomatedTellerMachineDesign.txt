HowTo 5.1 - 
1:
pin = 1234?

2:
System.out.println("Pin is correct!")
correct = true;

3:
count--;
System.out.println("Wrong pin! You have %d attempt(s) remaining\n", count);

4:
The condition is correct because you are checking to make sure the pin is exactly the same as 1234

5:
No duplication

6:
pin = 123;
- pin not equal to 1234 so second branch will execute
- count increments down
- print "Wrong pin! You have 2 attempt(s) remaining"

pin = 1234;
- pin satisfies condition so first branch will execute
- correct set to true
- print "Pin is correct!"

7:
if (pin.matches("1234)) {
    System.out.println("Your PIN is correct")
    correct = true;
}
else {
    System.out.printf("Wrong pin! You have %d attempt(s) remaining\n", count);
}
